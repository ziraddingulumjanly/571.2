The notebook in this repository includes the following machine-learning tasks:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Supervised Learning**: Implementation of various supervised learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and regression tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering using algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to find patterns and groupings in unlabeled data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analysis.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Application of ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to improve model performance.
- **Deep Learning**: Basics of neural networks, implementation of simple feedforward networks using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use of Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize machine learning models.
  
The solutions leverage Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch to implement and evaluate these models.
